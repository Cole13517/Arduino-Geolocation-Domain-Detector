# Project Description 
This Arduino project allows a user to send 4 location coordinates to the Arduino that will be received through a GSM900A module, the Arduino would then check the current location using a GPS module (NEO 6M) with the 4 location coordinates, the system would then display through the serial monitor if it's within the geolocation domain or outside it. 
### Components needed ###
* Arduino Mega 
* GSM900A GPRS Module 
* UBLOX NEO 6M GPS Module
